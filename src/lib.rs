//! # envvars
//!
//! `envvars` helps to detect a list of available shells and related environment
//! variables. If works in two steps:
//!
//! - detecting a list of available shells and creating `Profile` for each found
//!   shell
//! - loading a list of environment variables for selected or each shell
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Getting all available (detected) shells and related to each shell list of
//! environment variables
//!
//! ```
//! use envvars::{get_profiles, Profile};
//!
//! let mut profiles: Vec<Profile> = get_profiles().unwrap();
//!
//! // By default profile doesn't have loaded list of environment variables.
//! // It should be loaded calling method load().
//! profiles.iter_mut().for_each(|profile| {
//!     // Attempt to load envvars
//!     if let Err(err) = profile.load() {
//!         eprintln!("Cannot load envvars for {}: {err}", profile.name);
//!     }
//!     if let Some(envvars) = &profile.envvars {
//!         println!("Environment variables for {}", profile.name);
//!         envvars.iter().for_each(|(key, value)| {
//!             println!("{key}: {value}");
//!         });
//!     }
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! Extract environment variables without shell context.
//!
//! ```
//! use std::collections::HashMap;
//! use envvars::get_context_envvars;
//!
//! let vars: HashMap<String, String> = get_context_envvars().unwrap();
//!
//! assert!(vars.contains_key("PATH") || vars.contains_key("Path") || vars.contains_key("path"));
//! ```
//!
//! ## Diffrence from `std::env::vars`
//!
//! `envvars` actually executes each found `shell` it means: all settings of the target
//! shell will be inited before a list of environment variables will be requested. That's
//! very sensitive if the configuration of some shell includes some initialization script,
//! which affects environment variables. That means in some cases `std::env::vars` and
//! `envvars` could give different results.
//!  
//! ## How it works
//!
//! Under the hood, `envvars` takes each shell, and executes it with a command,
//! which posts a list of environment variables to `stdout`. As soon as executing
//! is done, `envvars` reads `stdout` and parse environment variables into
//! `HashMap<String, String>`.
//!
//! As soon as extracting process could take a sensitive time (~1sec on windows
//! and ~10ms on Unix-based OS), `envvars` doesn't extract environment variables
//! during detecting the shell's profiles. That's the developer's decision when it
//! should be done for the selected or each profile.
//!
//! `envvars` creates a small executable application in the system's temporary folder.
//! This application is used to "drop" list of environment variables into `stdout`
//! of the parent process and does nothing else. As soon as `envvars` instance is
//! dropped, the application would be removed from the disk.
//!
//! For security reasons `envvars` checks the checksum of the extractor each time
//! before using it. If a checksum is invalid (the file was damaged/changed etc),
//! `envars` will remove a corrupted file and create a new one.
//!  
//! ## Unix specific
//!
//! `envvars` reads `/etc/shells` and analyze each shell from a list
//!
//! ## Windows specific
//!
//! `envvars` checks for availability next shells:
//! - Command Prompt
//! - Windows PowerShell
//! - .NET Core PowerShell Global Tool
//! - Cygwin x64
//! - Cygwin
//! - bash (MSYS2)
//! - GitBash
//!
//! ## Guaranteed results
//!
//! Because `envvars` tries to initialize each shell and "drop" a list of environment
//! variables to `stdout`, the shell should support the possibility to put a command as
//! an argument, for example: `/bin/bash -c path_to_command`. Obviously not many, but
//! still some shells don't support it (like windows command prompt). In this case, you
//! still can use `get_context_envvars()` to get a list of environment variables without
//! the shell's context.
